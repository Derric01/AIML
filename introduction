 Introduction to AI and Machine Learning

1. What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that enables machines to mimic human intelligence. AI encompasses various techniques, including:
- Rule-based Systems: If-else logic for decision-making.
- Machine Learning (ML): Learning from data to make predictions.
- Deep Learning (DL): Neural networks inspired by the human brain.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): AI that understands and processes human language.
-Computer Vision:AI that enables machines to analyze images and videos.

2. What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on training models to recognize patterns and make decisions based on data. ML models improve their accuracy over time without being explicitly programmed.

#Types of ML:
1. Supervised Learning: The model learns from labeled data.
   - Example: Email spam detection (Spam/Not Spam)
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks

2. Unsupervised Learning:The model learns patterns from unlabeled data.
   - Example: Customer segmentation in marketing
   - Algorithms: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

3. Reinforcement Learning: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
   - Example: Training a robot to walk
   - Algorithms: Q-learning, Deep Q Networks (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

# 3. AI/ML Workflow
The typical steps in an AI/ML project include:
1. Problem Definition: Understanding the goal (e.g., predicting house prices).
2. Data Collection: Gathering relevant data from sources.
3. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical data.
4. Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming relevant features.
5. Model Selection: Choosing an appropriate ML algorithm.
6. Training the Model: Feeding data into the model and optimizing performance.
7. Evaluation: Measuring accuracy using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
8. Deployment:Integrating the model into real-world applications.
9. Monitoring & Improvement: Continuously improving the model with new data.

# 4. AI/ML Applications
- Healthcare: Disease prediction, medical image analysis.
- Finance: Fraud detection, stock price prediction.
- E-commerce: Recommendation systems (Amazon, Netflix).
- Autonomous Vehicles: Self-driving cars (Tesla, Waymo).
- Chatbots & Virtual Assistants:Siri, Alexa, ChatGPT
