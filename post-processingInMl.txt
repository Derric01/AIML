1️⃣ Train-Test Split & Data Preprocessing Pipeline
Use train_test_split to separate training and testing data.
Implement a Pipeline to automate preprocessing + modeling.
2️⃣ Model Selection & Training
Try different ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost).
Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
3️⃣ Model Evaluation
Compute accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Use roc_auc_score and precision-recall curve for classification.
Use R² score and MSE for regression.
4️⃣ Explainability & Interpretability
Already added SHAP, but you can visualize it better.
Use LIME for local explanations.
5️⃣ Feature Engineering for Specific Use Cases
Time Series Data: Lag features, rolling statistics.
NLP (Text Data): TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT embeddings.
Image Data: CNN feature extraction.
