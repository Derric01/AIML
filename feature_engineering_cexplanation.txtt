1️⃣ Feature Engineering Topics (Basic to Advanced)
#Basic Techniques
Handling Missing Data → Mean/Median/Mode Imputation, Forward/Backward Fill
Encoding Categorical Variables → One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding, Target Encoding
Feature Scaling → Standardization (Z-score), Min-Max Scaling, Robust Scaling
Feature Transformation → Log Transform, Power Transform, Box-Cox Transform

#Intermediate Techniques
Feature Selection → Correlation Matrix, Mutual Information, Chi-Square Test
Dimensionality Reduction → PCA (Principal Component Analysis), LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)
Polynomial Features → Generating new features using polynomial combinations of existing features

#Advanced Techniques
Feature Extraction
Text Data: TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT embeddings
Image Data: CNN Feature Extraction, Autoencoders
Time Series Feature Engineering
Rolling Mean, Lag Features, Seasonal Decomposition
Interaction Features → Multiplying or adding features to create new relationships

#Feature Selection with ML
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
SHAP & LIME for interpretability
